# Cartoonify 

Recently, I've been working on a project to Cartoonify any imageüòÑ and it is finally WorkingüèÉ‚Äç.The source code basically uses an image and blurs it out outlining it in binary form and making it look like a cartooned image.

The source code basically loads an image and then makes edge mask and then we reduce the noice while also reducing the color paletteüö¶. 

I am very new ‚ò∫ to this so i took help from data flair. Also if you wanna make any change into this code feel free to ping me. 

Also I'd like to state that this is not a new idea to work on and projects like this have been open sourced since a long time .Taking an idea from repository took matter into my hands while making this
